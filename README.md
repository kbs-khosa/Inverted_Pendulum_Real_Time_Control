# Inverted_Pendulum_Real_Time_Control
The project compares classical control theory and modern control theory by implementing closed-loop control for an inverted pendulum. 
# The project consists of various parts.
# First part derives the state and output equations from the given input-output equations of the system. This will lead to the calculation of the transfer function of the system.
# This is then followed by the calculation of controllable, observable and jordan canonical forms for the first part. The arbitrary initial conditions can help to evaluate the impulse and step response. Bode plot and root locus can also be plotted for the open loop system (classical control theory) in order to ccompare the results in the end.
# In order to test the behaviour and robustness of the system, step, square and sinusoidal responses can be calculated and also noise can be introduced alongwith the parameter variation.
# The second part of the project deals with the designing of the closed loop system and is based on the modern control theory.
# The two theories are compared by plotting the step. square and sinusoidal responses with arbitrary initial conditions for the closed loop system too.
# After the closed loop system has been realised, a full order and a reduced order observer is designed and step and sinusoidal responses are obtained for this case. In the final step, the transfer function of the observer and the controller are evaluated and analysed.
