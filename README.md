# Inverted_Pendulum_Real_Time_Control
# The project consisted of various parts.
# First part derived the state and output equations from the given input-output equations of the system. This lead to the calculation of the transfer function of the system.
# This was then followed by the calculation of controllable, observable and jordan canonical forms for the first part. The arbitrary initial conditions helped to evaluate the impulse and step response. Bode plot and root locus were also plotted for the open loop system (classical control theory) in order to compare the results in the end.
# In order to test the behaviour and robustness of the system, step, square and sinusoidal responses were calculated and also noise was introduced alongwith the parameter variations.
# The second part of the project dealt with the designing of the closed loop system and was based on the modern control theory.
# The two theories were compared by plotting the step, square and sinusoidal responses with arbitrary initial conditions for the closed loop system too and then comparing the results with that of the open loop system.
# After the closed loop system was realised, a full order and a reduced order observer was designed and step and sinusoidal responses were obtained for this case. In the final step, the transfer function of the observer and the controller were evaluated and analysed.
